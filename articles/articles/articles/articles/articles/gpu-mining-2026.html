<h1>Is GPU Mining Still Worth It in 2026?</h1>

<p>
GPU mining has changed drastically over the last few years. With Ethereum’s shift away from PoW,
miners have had to pivot — but new proof-of-work coins and AI compute rentals have opened new opportunities.
</p>

<h2>1. AI Compute Rentals</h2>
<p>
2026’s new “mining” is renting your GPUs to AI compute platforms. Far more profitable than altcoin mining.<br>

<h2>2. Kaspa (KAS) GPU Mining</h2>
<p>
Still one of the last profitable GPU coins thanks to fast block times and high adoption.<br>

<h2>3. Flux Mining</h2>
<p>
Decentralized cloud compute project — ideal for long-term miners betting on Web3 infrastructure.<br>

<h2>4. Dual-Mining Setups</h2>
<p>
Some rigs use parallel processes (mining + AI inference tasks) to maximize yield.<br>

<p>
Bottom line: GPU mining is evolving — not dead. AI compute + altcoin diversification makes it viable in 2026.
